## About CBASP Therapy

CBASP is a therapeutic approach specifically developed for the treatment of patients with chronic depression. It is a highly structured and directive approach that integrates behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic, and interpersonal approaches. CBASP was developed by James P. McCullough and has been empirically tested in scientific studies since 1980. It is the only psychotherapeutic approach for the treatment of long-lasting depressive disorders.

## About the Kiesler Circle

The Kiesler Circle is a communication model developed by the American psychologist Donald J. Kiesler in 1983. It describes how interpersonal interactions can be described on two axes: the axis of control with the poles “dominant” (open) and “submissive” (closed), and the axis of affiliation/relationship with the poles “friendly” (close) and “hostile” (distant). The Kiesler Circle graphically describes the taxonomy of interpersonal problems and plays a significant role in the psychotherapy of chronic depression with CBASP.

## Features

In the app, users can fill out and view various situation analyses, including future analysis, past analysis, and inner situation analysis. The app uses a chatbot from ConversationalForms and also has the Kiesler Circle implemented.

## Repository

The repository for the app can be found here: https://github.com/vaupunkt/cbaspCompanion
This project was created from the neue fische `next` template.

### ConversationalForms

[ConversationalForms](https://space10.com/project/conversational-form/) is an open-source concept by SPACE10 that turns web forms into conversations. It features conversational replacement of all input elements, reusable variables from previous questions, and complete customization and control over the styling.

### Chart.js

[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library for creating HTML5 charts. It is simple yet flexible and provides a wide range of chart types, plugins, and customization options. In the CBASP Companion app, it is used Chart.js to draw and make the Kiesler Circle interactive. This allows users to visualize their interpersonal interactions in a more engaging way.

I hope that this app will be a helpful tool for those undergoing CBASP therapy. If you have any questions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
